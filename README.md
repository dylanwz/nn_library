Hello World! A Brief README

The project is a very simplistic multilayer perceptron neural network. I wrote
it for education purposes, because it has the key foundations for how a neural
network works. 

First, all essential concepts are found in the pdf attached. The commenting in
`lib.rs` is primarily to guide how the aforementioned concepts may be implemen-
-ted in code. The ideas closely follows "Essence of Neural Networks" by 3b1b,
which can be found here: https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks,
and also of the book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael Nielsen,
which can be found here: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html.

Then, the two missing files are a set of training and testing data. They can be
found here: https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/. Please import them to 
`/src`.

Finally, this is very slow and insecure (everything is public and debug-able),
but the aim is to explore the key mechanisms that underpin neural networks. As
such, there is a greater emphasis on that, rather than speed and efficiency.

Highest accuracy: 75.5%.

(Last one is kind of cope lol).
